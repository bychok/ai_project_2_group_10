    "As stated, the goal is to create an indicator for `Economic Climate` based on broad-strokes observations of our datasets. Having calculated the rolling 12-month percent change for each feature - based off the rolling 12-month mean - we can look for a positive or negative change in values and flag the movement accordingly. From there, we can make the following simple statements;\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **CCI**, a positive change is \"good\", as it indicates an increase in the likelihood of consumers to spend money\n",
    "* For **CPI**, a negative change is \"good\", as it indicates a decrease in the costs for goods and services\n",
    "* For **Unemployment Rate**, a negative change is \"good\", as it indicates an incrase in the population active in the workforce\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can interpret movement contrary to those changes as \"bad\". With this simplified view of the features, we can draw a classification as follows;\n",
    "\n",
    "* If **at least two (2) features** have a \"good\" value, we can set `Economic Climate` to `Comfortable to Good`\n",
    "* If **at least two (2) features** have a \"bad\" value, we can set `Economic Climate` to `Lean to Bad`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we can gague whether the ecnomic state at a given rlease date supports or disproves our hypothesis."
